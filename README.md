# Bench-Press-Tracker

## Project Description
**Bench-Press-Tracker** is a simple console-based application for tracking bench press exercises. The app allows users to record their exercise data, including start and end times, duration, and additional comments. The goal of the project is to focus on key concepts such as data persistence, dependency injection, and separation of concerns, while keeping the business logic simple.

## Features
- Record bench press exercise sessions with start time, end time, duration, and comments.
- Data persistence using **Entity Framework**.
- Dependency injection for managing repository access from the controller.
- Clean architecture with separated layers for user input, business logic, and data access.

## Technologies
- **.NET (C#)**
- **Data Persistence**: Entity Framework Core.
- **Database**: **SQL Server**.
- **Dependency Injection**: To manage the repository access.
